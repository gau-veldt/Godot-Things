Mainly to show some issues I've posted about on FB Group

A small project demonstrating changing scenes with ResourceInteractiveLoader.
A small controllable character scene is loaded.

Space for jump

Mouse also turns on horizontal axis (no button) or
free-looks left or right (with left button).

Mouse vertical looks up or down.

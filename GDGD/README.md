GDNative via GDScript autocompiler project
License: MIT (same as Godot engine)

Note: includes NASM which is licnesed separately via 2-clause BSD license.  I believe this to
      be compatible to MIT so can be used in an exported game without restriction.

Note 2: Temporary use of GoLink for development.  GoLink is distributable noncommercially only
        precluding its use in exported games (which may become commercial).
        Therefore I'll need to migrate away from a linker eventually and generate binary
        dynalib GDNative blobs directly.
